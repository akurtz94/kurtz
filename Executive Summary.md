The purpose of this system is to create a model for a server where a user can upload a piece of software to determine the licenses and vulnerabilities.  The system will analyze the software and determine what licenses are tied to it and what vulnerabilities the system has, it will then present this information to the user and store it in the vulnerabilities and licenses database.
Having this knowledge is critical in developing an open source system so that copyrighted/licensed software isn't illegally borrowed without proper documentation/compensation.  This also allows users to know the down fall of using certain software code in their system.
