The motivation behind creating this system is because open source code borrows many pieces of code and software that have known licenses.  Being able to discover these licenses allows the user to deterimine what sorts of vulnerabilites may be present in their system so that one can ensure their system is secure.
With this specific system a software developer is able to upload a piece of source code.  The code is sent through the system to determine the licenses and vulnerabilities are present and the results are sent back to the developer and the manager. The manager is then able to see which licenses are against company policy and make whatever changes that are needed.
This new system will ensure that all licenses and vulnerabilities of open source software will be known and will notify the developer and the manager so that there are no weak points in the system.
